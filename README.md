# Automatic_Water_Dispenser_System_Using_Arduino
This project is an automatic water dispenser system that uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The system can dispense water automatically.
**### Automatic Water Dispenser System Using Arduino**
An automatic water dispenser system powered by Arduino, designed to provide a convenient and efficient way of dispensing water. This project uses an Arduino Uno, a sonar sensor, a water motor, a relay, a battery, a breadboard, and connecting wires.

### **Features**
Automatically dispenses water when triggered by the sonar sensor.
Adjustable water flow and dispensing duration.
Reliable and efficient water motor for smooth water dispensing.
Easy-to-use and intuitive setup.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Arduino Uno.
Sonar sensor.
Water motor.
Relay module.
9V battery.
Breadboard.
Connecting wires.
Installation
### **Connect the components as follows:**

Connect the VCC and GND pins of the sonar sensor to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino Uno, respectively.
Connect the trigger and echo pins of the sonar sensor to any digital pins of the Arduino Uno.
Connect the positive and negative terminals of the water motor to the relay module.
Connect the IN pin of the relay module to a digital pin of the Arduino Uno.
Connect the VCC and GND pins of the relay module to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino Uno, respectively.
Connect the battery to power the Arduino Uno.
Upload the Arduino sketch (code) to your Arduino Uno.

### **Usage**
Power on the system by connecting the battery.
Adjust the water flow by modifying the code if necessary.
Place the sonar sensor near the water container.
The sonar sensor will detect the presence of a container and trigger the water motor through the relay.
The water motor will dispense water for the specified duration.
Adjust the code and repeat the process as needed.
